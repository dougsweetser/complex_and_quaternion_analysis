Physically, I interpret each one as **an event in space-time**. This means that **real numbers are time**, and the **three imaginaries are for 3D space**. These events are moving at a steady pace in a steady direction. To my eye, that looks like an inertial observer. Inertial observers play a centeral role in special relativity."

    "Commuting quaternions??? The **defining characteristic** of quaternions is that they do not commute. This is true, they do not commute _unless the two quaternions point in the same or opposite directions_. It sounds reasonable to suppose this is a rare case. It absolutely is rare for mathematicians. A mathematical physicist as defined above needs to consider how data is collected for quantum experiments. Invariably, the data is collected in a very specific and tiny spot in space. If a beam of particles is ever-so-slightly off, then the experimentalist will collect no data. If data collection requires exquisitely precision for pointing equipement, how is that reflected in the math? Also how is the arbitrariness of the location in 3D space reflected, since a 90 mirror reflection in the beam line will force one to move the collection equipment but not change the math.\n",
